Most tools treat tasks like a grocery list. IndieCraft treats them like what they are: steps toward something bigger.

## The Problem

You've tried the enterprise tools. Jira, Monday, Asana, ClickUp - they all promise "agile workflows" and "cross-functional visibility" while burying you in dashboards, story points, and ceremonies that slow you down more than they help.

You're a small team. You don't need a system designed for 500-person orgs with dedicated project managers. You need to know what you're building, what's blocking you, and what's next.

## The Solution

IndieCraft is built around one core idea: **Goals drive tasks, not the other way around.**

Every task exists because it pushes a goal forward. Every goal exists because it ships something real. This isn't a philosophy - it's just how productive teams actually work.

### Goals First

Start with what you're trying to accomplish. A milestone. A feature. A deliverable. Give it a target date. That's your goal.

### Tasks Serve Goals

Break it down. What needs to happen to get there? Art assets, code features, audio, documentation - each task links to the goal it serves. Nothing floats in limbo.

### The Feedback Loop

As tasks complete, goals progress. You see momentum. Your team sees momentum. When a goal ships, you archive it and move on. No burndown charts. No velocity metrics. Just work getting done.

### Sprints Emerge Naturally

You don't need to force work into two-week boxes. When you organize around goals, sprints happen organically - clusters of tasks that ship together because they *belong* together. This is how real pipelines work, from two-person indies to AAA studios that forgot why they started using the frameworks they use.
